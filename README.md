# Trekbag

This is a checklist app that will help you plan your next trip.

Built using React, [react-select](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-select) and [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for state management on the main branch. Feel free to switch to the `redux-state` branch for an implementation that uses Redux instead of Zustand for state management.

Developed following the [Professional React & NextJS](https://bytegrad.com/courses/professional-react-nextjs) course curriculum by ByteGrad.
